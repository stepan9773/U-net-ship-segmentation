# README.md
## This code is an implementation of the U-Net model for image segmentation applied to the AirBus Ship Detection dataset. 
### This README file provides a brief introduction to the codebase, and how to use it.

## Getting Started
### Clone this repository: git clone 
### `https://github.com/stepan9773/U-net-ship-segmentation.git`
## Install dependencies: 
### `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Data
### The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found at AirBus Ship Detection Challenge.

## Usage
## 1. Define the path to the train and test directories in the Constants class located in the utils/Constants.py file.
## 2. To train the model, run train_example.ipynb file.
## 3. To test the model, run test.ipynb file.
## 4. To evaluate the model, run evaluate.ipynb file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tensorflow 2.x
- pandas
- numpy
- opencv-python-headless
